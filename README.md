PROJECT: SKYSENTRY STATUS: CLASSIFIED // LEVEL 4 DOMAIN: Tactical Air Defense & UI Systems

SkySentry is a next-generation tactical dashboard designed to solve cognitive overload for air defense commanders. It replaces cluttered legacy screens with a "Focus-First" Dark Mode UI that prioritizes real-time threat detection and rapid response.

OPERATIONAL GUIDE (How it Works) This is not just a static design. It is a fully interactive tactical simulator. Follow these steps to engage the system:

Access Command Console Click the Gear Icon in the left sidebar to open the hidden Settings Panel. This allows you to control the drone swarm logic.

Designate Target Click anywhere on the map. The system will instantly update the target coordinates, and all friendly jets (Green) will automatically re-route to intercept the new location.

Switch Engagement Modes The system has two distinct AI behaviors manageable via the settings:

DEFENSIVE MODE (Default): Jets will fly towards the target but maintain a safe distance. They will enter an "Orbit Pattern" (circle the target) to escort or monitor without engaging.

ATTACK MODE (The Fun Part): Select "ATTACK" in the settings. Jets will accelerate and fly directly into the target. When a jet enters the "Kill Zone" (less than 20km), the target will be DESTROYED (Visual explosion + Status Update).
