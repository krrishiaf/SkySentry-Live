PROJECT: SKYSENTRY STATUS: CLASSIFIED // LEVEL 4 DOMAIN: Tactical Air Defense & UI Systems

SkySentry is a next-generation tactical dashboard designed to solve cognitive overload for air defense commanders. It replaces cluttered legacy screens with a "Focus-First" Dark Mode UI that prioritizes real-time threat detection and rapid response.

O1. Access Command Console ⚙
Click the Gear Icon in the left sidebar.

This opens the hidden Settings Panel.

The panel allows you to control the drone swarm logic.

2. Designate Target 🎯
Click anywhere on the map.

The system instantly updates the target coordinates.

All friendly jets (Green ✈) automatically reroute to intercept the new target.

3. Switch Engagement Modes ⚔
The system supports two AI-controlled behaviors:

A. 🛡 DEFENSIVE MODE (Default)

Jets fly toward the target but maintain a safe distance.

They enter an Orbit Pattern (circle around the target).

Purpose: Escort or monitor without engaging.

B. 🚀 ATTACK MODE

Select “ATTACK” in the settings.

Jets accelerate and fly directly toward the target.

When a jet enters the Kill Zone (less than 20km):

💥 The target is DESTROYED.

⚠ A visual explosion occurs.

✅ The Status Update reflects the destruction.
