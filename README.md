1. Access Command Console ⚙️

Click the Gear Icon in the left sidebar.
This opens the hidden Settings Panel.
The panel allows you to control the drone swarm logic.

2. Designate Target 🎯

Click anywhere on the map.
The system instantly updates the target coordinates.
All friendly jets (Green ✈️) automatically reroute to intercept the new target.

3. Switch Engagement Modes ⚔️

The system supports two AI-controlled behaviors:

A. 🛡️ DEFENSIVE MODE (Default)

Jets fly toward the target but maintain a safe distance.
They enter an Orbit Pattern (circle around the target).
Purpose: Escort or monitor without engaging.

B. 🚀 ATTACK MODE

Select “ATTACK” in the settings.
Jets accelerate and fly directly toward the target.
When a jet enters the Kill Zone (less than 20km):

💥 The target is DESTROYED.

⚠️ A visual explosion occurs.

✅ The Status Update reflects the destruction.
